# 🛠️ Offset Rig Software VB

Welcome to the unified repository for the **End-of-Line (EOL) check software** running on the physical "Offset" calibration/test stations in **Unit 3**. 

This project represents the modernization, consolidation, and refactoring of legacy Visual Basic 6 (VB6) codebases migrated to the **twinBASIC** compiler ecosystem.

---

## 📌 Project Purpose & Genesis

### Origin
This project was born on **10/06/26**, forking the legacy EOL check systems.

### The Challenge
With the introduction of new products and changing quality verification standards, the EOL stations received a surge in feature requests. The legacy codebase was fragmented across separate folders for each station (Offset 1, Offset 2, Offset 3), resulting in duplicated code, hardcoded hardware variations, and severe maintainability issues.

### The Mission
The core goal of this project is two-fold:
1. **Unification:** Consolidate all physical testing stations into a **single, unified codebase** driven by configuration.
2. **Modernization:** Clean up legacy code smells, simplify data parsers, and restructure logic to prepare the software for future translation into modern language frameworks (e.g., Python or C#). Both human and AI auditors are utilized to target improvements.

## 🚀 Key Modernizations Achieved

*   **🎛️ Codebase Unification:** Consolidated three distinct, station-specific project directories into one repository. Station-specific hardware identifiers (VISA IDs), calibration constants, and timing delays have been abstracted into a single local config file: `offset_config.txt`.
*   **🔌 Dynamic Current Draw Overrides:** Replaced duplicated hardcoded current limits with dynamic limits loaded from `current_draw.txt` on a per-product-range basis.
*   **🔋 AM Product Range Exceptions:** Added exception rules for the new `"AM"` product line, mapping them dynamically to the existing `"UB"` product rules.
*   **📂 Dynamic File Parsing:** Replaced the legacy fixed-length loops with modern `Do While Not EOF(FileHandle)` structures.
*   **Option Explicit Directives:** Enforced strict variable declaration compilation checks across all key modules, resolving dozens of implicit type compiler warnings.
*   **Line of Best Fit Resistor Conversion:** Replaced the 1,000+ line hardcoded resistor mapping table with a single Line of Best Fit equation ($R^2 = 99.998\%$) in `CheckLoad()`.
*   **🎚️ Consolidated DMM Switching:** Consolidated over 80 repetitive switching card functions in `DigitalMultimeterControl.bas` and removed massive duplicate `If PinOutSwitch = ...` blocks in `OffsetCheck.bas`, routing all relays through a single parameterized `RouteDMM` function.
*   **Safe Excel COM Lifecycle:** Overhauled the Excel reporting parser to cleanly close workbooks and release reference counts in order, eliminating `excel.exe` process leaks.
*   **🌍 Configuration-Driven Paths:** Abstracted all local and network file paths into configuration parameters loaded from `offset_config.txt` with zero-config backward-compatible defaults.
*   **🐛 Scanner Logic Nesting Bug Fix:** Corrected the nesting structure in the interlock scanner inside [InputsOutputs.bas](file:///c:/Users/lewis.heslop/Downloads/Offset%20Rig%20Software%20VB/InputsOutputs.bas) to enable monitoring of all hardware input bits.
*   **🔒 Concurrency-Safe File Access:** Overhauled shared Excel sheet updates (`WorksOrder.xls`) and works order database scans (`paulseal.txt`) to implement interactive warning-based retry loops on failure. Configured network logging (`yyyymmdd.log`) to utilize silent retries with an automatic fallback to local backups to prevent data loss or operator interruption.

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Backlog (Identified by Human Auditors)

We have identified several critical areas for improvement to be resolved in upcoming sprints:

> [!NOTE]
> **Database Consolidation Intent:**
> In the future, we intend to consolidate the multiple separate text files currently used to store long-term rig databases (such as `Board Type.txt`, `union list.txt`, `connector type.txt`, `Colour list.txt`, and `cable list.txt`) into a single structured configuration or a shared SQLite database. Since these parameters are identical across all three physical Offset calibration stations, moving to a unified configuration source will simplify change management and ensure absolute data alignment across rigs.

### 🏷️ A. Version Control & Release Management
*   **The Issue:** Right now, versioning is arbitrary (indicated only by `"V34"` in the main form title and `"V34.1"` in the binary's filename).
*   **The Plan:** Remove hardcoded version strings from the UI titles and filenames. Hide the active version string inside a Help/About menu. Version identifiers will correspond exactly to the **Git repository tags** under which the binaries are compiled.

### 🧹 B. Code Smells & Refactoring
*   **Overcomplicated Barcode Parsing (`Barcode.bas`):** The parsing engine for works order sheet barcodes is excessively complex and brittle. It will be refactored into a clean, pattern-matching regex/substring scanner.

### 🗺️ C. Hardcoded Product Process Variations
*   **The Issue:** Operators cannot easily tell which testing process a particular product range will follow because routing logic is hardcoded inside branching conditional statements.
*   **The Plan:** 
    *   Clearly define and document the possible EOL testing processes.
    *   Determine the most common test path and establish it as the default system behavior.
    *   Create a clean lookup dictionary of product range overrides to route non-standard products to their respective custom tests.

### 📋 D. Network Logging Usefulness Review
*   **The Issue:** The software logs rig telemetry and diagnostics to a daily shared network log file (`yyyymmdd.log`). However, there is no active usage or consumer identified for these log files.
*   **The Plan:** Review the necessity and utility of this logging with engineering to decide whether it should be simplified, redirected, or decommissioned to save network and storage bandwidth.

## 🤖 AI-Identified Issues (Architectural & Code Quality Audit)

During the codebase unification process, our AI static analysis tool audited the source files and identified several critical code quality and architectural vulnerabilities. The remaining unresolved issues are listed below:



### 🟡 Medium Severity

#### 2. Hardcoded Calibration Constants in PSU Controls
*   **Location:** [ControlPSU.bas](file:///C:/Users/lewis.heslop/Downloads/Offset%20Rig%20Software%20VB/ControlPSU.bas#L30)
*   **The Issue:** Hardware calibration compensation values (`Supply * 0.986` and `Supply * 0.9645`) are hardcoded into the PSU voltage settings.
*   **Impact:** Since these scaling factors compensate for wiring resistance and voltage drops, they are station-dependent. They should be configured in `offset_config.txt` rather than hardcoded in source.

#### 3. Brittle Magic-Index Barcode Parsing
*   **Location:** [OffsetCheck.bas](file:///C:/Users/lewis.heslop/Downloads/Offset%20Rig%20Software%20VB/OffsetCheck.bas) and [Barcode.bas](file:///C:/Users/lewis.heslop/Downloads/Offset%20Rig%20Software%20VB/Barcode.bas)
*   **The Issue:** Barcode parameters are parsed using hardcoded substring indices (e.g. `Mid$(MainForm.SecondMCSBarcode, 17, 4)`) without any bounds checking or format validation.
*   **Impact:** Any changes to the printed barcode layout will silently parse incorrect pressure and scaling limits, risking false calibration runs without throwing format errors.
